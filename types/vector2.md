# Vector2

Vector2s consist of two components: `x`, `y`.

## Constructors

`vector3(float x, float y)`

## Methods

`vector2` `a:dot(vector2 b)`  
Returns the dot product vector between `a` and `b`

`float` `a:length()`  
Returns `a`'s length

`vector2` `a:normal()`  
Returns a normalised version of `a`

`vector2` `a:min(vector3 b)`  
Returns a vector composed of the minimum values between `a` and `b`

`vector2` `a:max(vector3 b)`  
Returns a vector composed of the maximum values between `a` and `b`
