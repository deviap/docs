## Docs home

The Deviap docs contain all of our documentation and tutorials and provide a brillaint starting point if you're just getting to grips with our platform, and an excellent reference if you're an experienced user.

Some parts of this documentation are automatically generated using our API, while examples are usually provided by our IX Team.
See something that needs fixed? The docs are [open source](https://github.com/deviap/docs)!

------
To get started, use the navigation bar on the left side of the screen. You can find tutorials, types, classes and enums under their respective headers.
If you're converting some Teverse code to work here, make sure you view the [Breaking changes](https://deviap.com/docs/breaking-changes) we made to our API.
